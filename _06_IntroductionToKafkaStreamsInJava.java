    // 1. Overview

    // In this article, we'll be looking at the KafkaStreams library. // https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/

    // KafkaStreams is engineerd by the creators of Apache Kafka.
    // The primary goal of this piece of software is to allow programmers
    // to create efficient, real-time streaming applications that could work as Microservices.

    // KafkaStreams enables us to consume from Kafka topics,
    // analyze or transform data, and potentially, send it to another Kafka topic.

    // To demonstrate KafkaStreams, we'll create a simple application that reads sentences
    // from a topic, counts occurrences of words and prints the count per word.

    // Important to note is that the KafkaStreams library isn't reactive
    // and has no support for async operations and backpressure handling.
