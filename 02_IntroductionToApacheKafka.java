// 2. What Is Kafka?

// https://kafka.apache.org/
// Kafka is an open-source stream processing platform developed by the Apache Software Foundation.
// We can use it as a messaging system to decouple message producers and consumers,
// but in comparison to "classical" messaging systems like ActiveMQ,
// it is designed to handle real-time data streams and provides
// a distributed, fault-tolerant, and highly scalable architecture for processing and storing data.

// Therefore, we can use it in various use cases:
// * Real-time data processing and analytics
// * Log and event data aggregation
// * Monitoring and metrics collection
// * Clickstream data analytics
// * Fraud detection
// * Stream processing in big data pipelines
