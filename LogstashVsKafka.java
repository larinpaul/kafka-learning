// 1. Overview

// Logstash and Kafka are two powerful tools for managing real-time data streams.
// While Kafka excels as a distributed event streaming platform,
// Logstash is a data processing pipeline for ingesting, filtering, and forwarding data to various outputs.

// In this tutorial, we'll examine the difference between Kafka and Logdash in more detail 
// and provide examples of their usage.


// 2. Requirements

// Before learning the difference between Logstash and Kafka, let's ensure we have a few
// prerequisites installed and basic knowledge of the technologies involved.
// First, we need to install Java 8 or later. // https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/install/overview-jdk-installation.html

// Logstash is part of the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) // https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elastic-stack/current/installing-elastic-stack.html
// but can be installed and used independently.
// For Logstash, we can visit the official Logstash download page // https://www.elastic.co/downloads/logstash
// and download the appropriate package for our operatiing system (Linux, macOS, or Windows).

// We also need to install Kafka // https://www.baeldung.com/apache-kafka
// and have confidence in our understandng of the publisher-subscriber model. // https://www.baeldung.com/cs/publisher-subscriber-model
