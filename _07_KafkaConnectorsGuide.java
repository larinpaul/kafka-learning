// 1. Overview

// Apache KafkaÂ® is a distributed streaming platform.
// In a previous tutorial, we discussed 
// how to implement Kafka consumers and producers using Spring. // https://www.baeldung.com/spring-kafka

// In this tutorial, we'll learn how to use Kafka Connectors.

// We'll have a look at:
// * Different types of Kafka Connectors
// * Featuresand modes of Kafka Connect
// * Connectors configuration using property files as well as the REST API.


// 2. Basics of Kafka Connect and Kafka Connectors

// Kafka Connect is a framework for connecting Kafka with external systems
// such as databases, key-value stores, search indexes, and file systesm,
// using so-called Connectors.

// Kafka Connectors are ready-to-use components, which can help us to import data
// from external systes into Kafka topics
// and export data from Kafka topics into external systems.
// We can use existing connector implementations for common data sources
// and sinks or implement our own connectors.

// A source connector collects data from a system.
// Source systems can be entire databases, streams tables, or message brokers.
// A source connector could also collect metrics from application servers into Kafka topics,
// making the data available for stream processing with low latency.

// A sink connector delivers data from Kafka topics into other systems,
// which might be indexes such as Elasticsearch, batch systems such as Hadoop,
// or any kind of database.

// Some connectors are maintained by the community, 
// while others are supported by Confluent or its partners.
// Really, we can find connectors for most popular systems, 
// like S3, JDBC, and Cassandra, just to name a few.


// 3. Features

// Kafka Connect features include:

// * A framework for connecting external systems with Kafka - it simplifies the development,
// deployment, and management of connectors
// *
